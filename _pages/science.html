      I am a scientist
    </h1>
    <p>
      My love of science stretches back to before I can remember. Starting with bug catching in the backyard, to deciding that cloning would be a great 5<sup>th</sup> grade science project, to beginning a Ph.D. program in biochemistry, science has been a driving force in my life.
      
      I love doing science, and I love sharing science.
