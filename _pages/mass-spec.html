    <h1>Mass Spectrometry</h1>

    <p>
      I was introduced to mass spectrometry in one of my high school chemistry classes. Our textbook had a diagram of a simple mass spectrometer and a caption that talked about how electric and magnetic fields could be used to separate ions based on their mass. I don't know why, but I was drawn to this diagram.

      Once I decided on biochemistry as a major, I immediately started looking at labs to join because I wanted to get involved in research. I was introduced to Dr. John Prince at BYU and I learned he did research with mass spectrometry. I asked him what classes I should take in preparation to join the lab, but he told me to just start coming to lab meeting because if I waited to take the right classes I would be graduating by the time I was ready.

      Those lab meetings were quite overwhelming at first, but I stuck with it. My first paper ended up coming out of Dr. Prince's lab in the form of a lipid classification paper that I helped with.

      After my first year in the lab, Dr. Prince decided to take a job elsewhere so I switched over to the lab of Dr. John Price. My job was to develop an algorithm to extract the isotopic envelopes for each identified peptide. This data was to be used as part of a bigger program that calculated protein turnover. A demo of how the algorithm works can be seen in the below video:

      I am currently working on some node js modules for working with chemical data. You can view the modules on my <a href="https://github.com/emptyport?tab=repositories">github page</a> and they are available through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~emptyport">npm</a>.
