This is my personal site for whatever information I think should exist on the web.

### Building
All editing and building must be done from the src directory.

Make sure everything is installed by running ```bundle```

You can preview the site at ```localhost:4000``` by running ```make serve```

Once you are ready to push the new version to Github, run ```make build```, move up out of the src directory, and then commit your changes and push.
